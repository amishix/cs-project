## Reflections:

Reflect on your experience of creating this project. Fill in the following prompts:

- **Thinking:** How did you approach this project's problem-solving? Referring to different codes, observing where to put variables, and noting how in-class practice has helped us develop shapes—in addition, with paper and pens, I've been able to draw a probable outcome of what I want my final product to be and create a flowchart of the many codes I can use.

- **Reading:**Deciphering the meaning of codes in documentation is crucial. For example, ellipses and half-pis were useful in designing the mouth and eyes. However, interpreting code is quite simple, since it helps you understand what to write and how to convey your ideas.
 
- **Copying and Modifying:** I utilised code snippets to create the basis, and with the aid of rgb, I was able to determine how to differentiate the colour from a plain yellow hue. I was also able to alter the form of the ellipse by using mouseX and mouseY. 
  
- **Writing Code:**Using the mouse, I was able to make this project interactive. The background can be changed from white to a dark purple colour as you move the mouse. Although it was difficult to write the code from scratch because minor mistakes could cause errors, the perseverance that results from doing extensive research and comprehending the task at hand makes the effort worthwhile.

- **Challenges and Learnings:** The biggest obstacles were figuring out how to make it interactive—I was inspired by pop art—and how to accurately measure and enlarge the emojis' faces, eyes, and mouths. The emojis' faces could expand in response to mouse movements.
