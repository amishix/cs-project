# Journal Project Two


## Reflections:

Reflect on your experience of creating this project. Fill in the following prompts:

- **Thinking:** flow charts of what you want your calendar to look like was extremely helpful,I was able to write code of how to print grids by the help of for and while loops in guiding the turtle graphic cursor.


- **Reading:** Best help was to use guides of codes from previous lessons where we learnt to utilise for and while loops to repeat certain actions,rather than you writing the same code repetetively.


- **Copying and Modifying:** I used code snippets of colour change so i can customise the background colours as well as codes of defining certain functions 


- **Writing Code:** writing code involves alot of trial and error and should focus mainly on how to achieve your desired result ,it can be done through decoding each line and using that line to write code further in.


- **Challenges and Learnings:** main challenges faced were not being able to define screen or turtle to realise those functions had to be defined in the beginning also not being able to draw the grid of the calendar perfectly had to be sorted with for loop using i in range.
